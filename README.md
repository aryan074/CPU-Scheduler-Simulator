### **CPU Scheduler Simulator**



##### **Project Overview**

The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator is a web-based application developed to demonstrate the working of major CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The system allows users to input process information and visually observe how different scheduling strategies affect execution order and performance metrics.

This project helps students understand core operating system concepts through practical simulation and visualization.
